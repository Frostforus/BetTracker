# BetTracker
My very own bet tracking app. For all your bet tracking needs.

How to install:
Use through android studio. The app is not available on the playstore.

# How to use:

Press the "settings" button, then set your name. The notifications option isn't finished yet.

Press the "My bets" button to see your bets,you can add new bets through pressing the floating action buttons. The floating action button on the right, lets new add a completely new bet, you can give the person you want to have the bet with and what you're betting on, you can give a deadline too.
Pressing the action button on the left allows you to scan a QR code from someone elses app.
You can check out a bets details by clicking on it, or you can delete it by clicking on the delete button.

From this screen you can check your bets and see what bets are your newest bets.

The "Statistics" button lets you see your win/lose ratio.

Not all the features are implemented, but most features work properly.

Feel free to add any issues you find with my app.

This was a project for a computer science subject: "mobile and web apllications".
